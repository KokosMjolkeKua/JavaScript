Objects: Creation:
- creating objects(making methods that allow you to create new objects based on existing objects)

Using in html:
- added JAVASCRIPT
- in console, ask Employee, person and person.greet()
- 

can define how a class looks like and the externally change the variables
- some are uniquie, but some can be changed (same concept but you work with the objects instead of classes.)



Dom Manipulations:
- will not wait for other functions to start/finished
- eks; console.log, alert etc 
- in javascript network requests are async in nature

implementing load functions - async functions
- ways to do (fetchAPI)

Async Promises: 
- a promise is an object representing the eventual execution(succesful or otherwise)
- if we use the keyword await, it returns a promise, so resolve
