# Task 3
This is the folder where you solve both Task 3.1 and 3.2.

Task 3.1: JavaScript function with constant
Created a function that multiplies a number by a constant
Used the meters-to-yards conversion value as the constant (one meter is 1.0936132983 yards)
Displayed results using console.log

Task 3.2: Conditional logic based on conversion result
Extended Task 3 by checking if the converted value was greater than 300 yards
console.log a message such as “That is a really long golf drive” when the condition was met
